The binary numbers just are numbers storing values in base $2$

## Signed Values

Exist two ways to put signed values in base $2$:

**1.** With the first bit, that when $1$ means that the number is negative, and when $0$ means the opposite

**2.** With the "Two's complement notation" wich defines that the first bit informs if the number is negative or not, but if it's, then the number referent to the first bit will be subtracted to the number. For example $[01100000]$ is $96$, but $[11100000]$ is $96 - 128 = - 32$ because $10000000=128$
